# React Photo Gallery 

## Description
The objective of this weekend challenge was to build an image gallery to display a portion of who we are and of things that are significant to us! I chose to display pictures of things that have been meaningful experiences, as well as, quotes and things I want to manifest in 2022!

The photo gallery should: 
* DISPLAY images from the realtional database and display on the front-end
* Allow a user to:
    * ADD an image to the photo gallery
    * DELETE an image from the gallery
    * UPDATE an image by clicking the 'like' button
    * VIEW the image description by clicking on the image

Things to note: 
1. The images themselves are not stored in the database, only a path to the image. 
2. Currently, images are only able to be uploaded through a URL.

## Prerequisites 
* Node.js
* React
* Material-UI

## Installation
1. Create your database under the name: 'react_gallery'
2. The queiries in the table.sql file are set up to create all necessary table rows necessary for application to run correctly. The project is built using Postgres. We recommend using Postico to run the queries for best results. 
3. Open up your editor and run 'npm install'
4. Run 'npm run server' in your terminal 
5. Open a new terminal and run 'npm run client'
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you automatically!

## Usage 
1. Users should add pictures and quotes to the 2022 mood board that represent what they hope to achieve in 2022. 
2. Photos can be added directly via the database or through the webpage through a hosted url
3. Users will want to deploy the app to share with others! Viewers can interact with the gallery by liking and deleting photos! Make sure you only delete your own photos.
